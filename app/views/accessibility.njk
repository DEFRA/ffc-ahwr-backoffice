      <p class="govuk-body">
        This accessibility statement applies to the back-office website used by RPA staff managing applications and claims for the Improve Animal Health and Welfare service. 
        <br/><br/>
        This website is run by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA). We want the website to be accessible by anyone who needs to use it. For example, that means you should be able to: 
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li> zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen </li>
          <li> navigate most of the website using just a keyboard </li>
          <li> navigate most of the website using speech recognition software </li>
          <li> listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver) </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the text as simple as possible to understand. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        <a class="govuk-link" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">
